# Chatbot Project  

## Overview  
This project is a **chatbot** built using Python and Jupyter Notebook. It demonstrates natural language processing (NLP) and chatbot interactions, allowing users to communicate with an AI-based system.  

## Features  
- Implements a chatbot using Python.  
- Processes user inputs and generates appropriate responses.  
- Utilizes machine learning/NLP techniques (if applicable).  
- Runs in a Jupyter Notebook environment for easy execution and modification.  

## Installation  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
   ```  
2. Install the required dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:  
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```  

## Usage  
1. Open `chatbot.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run the notebook cells sequentially.  
3. Interact with the chatbot in the provided interface or terminal.
